# Start here next session

The gate **prints its own totals** (`bash ports/vulkan/gates/run_gate.sh`) — do not quote a number here, it went
stale twice in one day. Wave 1 (elementwise / conversions / norm / silu / gdn) and both GEMM paths and rope are
done and gated.

## Done since this file was last written

- `gemm_coopmat.comp` — the cooperative-matrix GEMM (matrix units). Verified on RADV on three shapes; a device
  without a usable config is a loud SKIP, never a pass.
- `gemm_fma.comp` — the plain-FMA GEMM with **no shape precondition**, so it is both the decode path (M=1 is
  structurally impossible for the CMA path) and the fallback where no CMA config exists (llvmpipe). The engine
  selects by **shape first**, device capability second.
- `rope_neox.comp` — NEOX partial RoPE, one thread per row, table passed in from the host.
- `kv_q8_append.comp` — the 8-bit KV append (the storage half of kv_q8). Verified **byte-exact over the whole
  destination image** against a transcription of the engine's own quantisation formula, so a wrong ROW is as
  visible as a wrong code: four cases (VRAM page resident; page absent, where a sentinel image must stay
  untouched; and the host copy in the identity layout, written unconditionally in both table states), covering the
  all-zero group (scale 0), all-negative, values on ± the group maximum, and a maximum past fp16 range.

## mrope: SETTLED, by reading the source rather than assuming

`mrope_pos(tab, pos, pair)` in `include/strata/kernels/mrope.hpp` is `tab ? tab[pos * 3 + pair % 3] : pos`:

- **null table (the default) means the identity** — the position the caller passes IS the rotary position. Text.
- set, `pos` is a **CELL index** into an int32 `[cells][3]` (t, h, w) table, and pair `i` takes sector `i % 3`.
  That is the vision path (qwen4exp's interleaved M-RoPE, `dimension_sections` 11/11/10/0).

A Vulkan descriptor cannot be null, so the kernel takes an explicit `mrope` flag instead.

**DEVIATION from this file's original interface table** (which specified push `{int rows; int head_dim; int
n_rot;}`): the push is `{rows, head_dim, n_rot, mrope}` = **16 bytes**. The alternative — a host-built identity
table — was rejected: it allocates and fills an N×3 array just to express "no table", and it routes the text path
through the vision path's indexing.

## The buffer registry: DECIDED, deliberately deferred

Keep loose buffers plus per-kernel push constants for now; do **not** build the registry yet. This file's own
prediction is the reason: the interface convention gets its first real test in the **GEMV wave** (weight layouts,
not elementwise), and a registry designed before that would encode elementwise assumptions as though they were
general. Its value is at ~44 kernels, and its caller is the engine integration (PORT-PLAN stage 4/6). Written
down so the deferral is a decision rather than an oversight.

## rope_neox: the gate case, and one tolerance decision worth carrying forward

The case follows this file's spec — host oracle is `build_rope_table`'s float64 loop **copied**, NEOX pairing from
`rope_neox_pair`, **bit-exact** tail sentinels, adversarial positions — with one change: the rotation bound is
2^-20 of the near-cancellation form, not the 2^-7 written here. Those constants were for kernels that *compute*
their angles on device (fast-math sin/cos differ in the last bits); this port **passes the table**, so the only
difference left is float-vs-double in one multiply-add. Measured worst err/tol ratio **0.11** — the tightened
bound still has ~9× headroom, while the loose one would have accepted a rotation wrong by ~100×.

Two traps hit while writing it, both worth not repeating:

- **`half` is a reserved word in GLSL.** `const int half = n_rot / 2;` fails to compile; it is `nhalf` here.
- **Bit-exactness is only for the parts the kernel COPIES.** The in-place case first compared every element
  exactly and reported 494/512 "failures" — the reference is computed in double, so the rotated elements *must*
  differ in the last bits. Split the comparison: exact for the copied tail, err/tol for the arithmetic. The
  shader was correct throughout.

## ONE FINDING TO CARRY INTO EVERY fp16-KERNEL PORT: `packHalf2x16` is NOT the engine's conversion

Measured on RADV while porting kv_q8. `packHalf2x16` **saturates to the largest finite half** (0x7BFF) where the
engine's `f16_from_f32` returns **infinity** (0x7C00), and its tie and subnormal rounding is not the engine's
nearest-even either. The effect is silent and small: a KV group whose maximum exceeds fp16 range gets a finite
scale instead of an infinite one, so its codes come out 127 instead of 0 — one group, in a branch normal data
never reaches. The gate caught it as exactly 73 differing bytes.

Use the port's own `f16_from_f32` (transcribed from `strata/kernels/f16_bits.hpp`, and held bit-exact by the
`f32_to_f16` case) in every kernel that converts. Reading a half BACK is a pure widening conversion with no
rounding to get wrong, so `unpackHalf2x16` is exact and stays.

## kv_q8 is COMPLETE (append, gather, round trip)

`kv_q8_append.comp` and `kv_q8_gather.comp` are both in and gated, and the pair is verified as a **round trip**
(floats -> append -> gather -> compare with the originals). Measured worst `|x'-x| / scale` = **0.53**, which is
what a correct round-to-nearest quantiser gives: below one code step, so the quantiser is optimal rather than
merely inside a loose bound. The round trip is also bit-exact against the host oracle, which only holds if the
scale the append WROTE is exactly the scale the gather READS.

The gather also settles a conversion question the append raised: a group whose scale lands in the fp16
**subnormal** range round-trips exactly, so `unpackHalf2x16` and the engine's `f32_from_f16` agree there - it is
only the PACKING direction where the builtin differs (see the packHalf2x16 section above).

The engine's fp16 converter now lives in ONE place, `shaders/common/f16_bits.glsl`, included by the three kernels
that convert (`#include` works in glslc, resolved relative to the including file). Three copies of a bit-exact
function were three chances to diverge, and `shaders/*.comp` deliberately does not glob into `common/`.

## quantize_act: the q8_0 trio is in, q8_K is next

`quantize_q8_0.comp` (ggml's bytes), `quantize_q8_0_scaled.comp` (this engine's CPU path), `dequant_q8_0.comp`.
Every comparison is `==` on the 34-byte block, because this is a reproduction of someone else's quantiser.

**TWO quantisers for ONE layout is the design, not duplication:** the first reproduces GGML's bytes (what the
pack holds, what `moe_hit_parity` checks), the second reproduces THIS ENGINE's CPU reference, because a hit and a
miss for the same expert must produce the same number. They round differently ON PURPOSE - and the gate proves
both rather than one: a synthetic block whose maximum is exactly 127 makes `d32` exactly 1.0, so eight of its
values sit on EXACT rounding ties, and the two rules disagree on **19 of 32 codes** there (half-even vs
half-away). A single oracle would have tested the wrong contract for one of them.

Two things worth carrying forward:

* **`precise` is the portable `__fmul_rn`.** GLSL's `precise` emits `OpDecorate NoContraction`, which is how a
  rounded multiply is pinned against being contracted into an FMA - the same thing the CUDA source does
  explicitly, and what `quantize_q8_K` needs for its `nearest_int` magic.
* **"One code step" is the wrong error bound when the stored scale is SUBNORMAL.** The codes round against the
  fp32 `d32` but the block stores fp16 `d16`, so the error is
  `0.5*|d32| + |q| * |d16 - d32|`. The second term is negligible while `d16` is normal and dominates once it is
  subnormal (the fp16 grid step there is fixed at ~6e-8, so a small `d32` is represented coarsely). Measured: the
  naive bound failed by 1.15x on exactly that block, and the two-term bound is hit at a ratio of 1.00 - tight, not
  loose.

## quantize_act is COMPLETE (five kernels, all byte-exact)

`quantize_q8_K.comp` and `dequant_q8_K.comp` finish the file: 292 bytes per 256 elements,
`{ f32 d ; int8 qs[256] ; int16 bsums[16] }`, the other half of `VEC_DOT_TYPE` and the format the numerically
SENSITIVE weights use. Byte-exact over all six blocks (1816/1816 bytes, guard region included) plus the 16 int16
sums per block.

Three traps that were transcribed from the source and are now pinned by the gate:

* `iscale = -127/max`, NOT -128. The -128 version sits in the source COMMENTED OUT with a note that IQ2_XXS needs
  it for an awkward AVX path; using it is a 0.79% scaling error, the same order as the quantisation step, so it
  produces an activation that looks fine and that ggml never sees.
* `max` is the SIGNED value at the largest magnitude and the comparison is STRICTLY greater, so a tie keeps the
  FIRST element. What that means in practice: `code(x) = round(-127 * x/mx)`, so the element HOLDING the maximum
  lands on -127 whatever its sign, and the opposite extreme lands on +127. A test written from the intuitive
  phrasing ("a positive max maps to -127") gets a negative maximum backwards - it did, and the byte-exact check
  overruled it. The rule is now its own four-element check.
* The rounding is `nearest_int`'s round-half-to-EVEN via the 12582912.0f magic, NOT `round`'s half-away. The tie
  block separates them on **159 of 256 codes** - the sharpest evidence yet that a rule was implemented rather
  than approximated.

The zero block is written in full (d, qs AND bsums). ggml's `continue` leaves bsums unwritten, which a dot product
cannot tell from zero but a byte comparison can; the source records the divergence deliberately and the gate holds
it. `min(127, v)` likewise has no lower counterpart - defensive, since `|iscale*x| <= 127` by construction.

### One comparison rule learned twice in this file

A kernel's f32 result can only be compared against a HIGHER-PRECISION oracle when the result is exactly
representable. A q8_0 dequant multiplies a 7-bit code by an 11-bit fp16 (18 bits - exact in f32, so a `double`
oracle agreed by luck). q8_K multiplies the same 7-bit code by a full 24-bit fp32 scale: up to 31 bits, NOT
representable, so the device's correctly rounded f32 product differs from the exact double one and 687 of 1536
values "failed". Round the oracle to f32 the way the kernel rounds before comparing, and confine bit-exactness to
where it is genuinely exact rather than merely convenient.

### Next: `ple`, then the GEMV wave

`ple.cu` is the last of the non-GEMV kernels. Then `native_bf16.cu`, `s_gemv.cu`, `s2_gemv*.cu` - throughput
lives there, and the interface convention gets its first real test (weight layouts, not elementwise).

Same shape as every case so far: read the CUDA source first, build the oracle from the engine's own function
(never from a description of it), sentinel every range the kernel must not touch, and give each branch of the
source an adversarial case. Tolerances come from measurement - print the err/tol ratio and keep it visible.
