# Status — what is done, what is verified, what is not

## Done and verified in this session

Everything below is backed by a command that exits non-zero on failure. Re-run it with:

    bash ports/vulkan/gates/run_gate.sh          # compiles the shaders from source, validates the SPIR-V,
                                                 # checks each shader's declared local size, then runs the gate

**Result: 14 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** on the box's GPU
(`AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX (RADV NAVI31)`, Vulkan 1.4.318, subgroup size 64).

| Case | Verdict | Method |
|---|---|---|
| harness self-test (copy) | PASS 1024/1024 | bit-exact — proves bindings, push range and host-read barrier |
| `scale_inplace` | PASS 1000/1000 | bit-exact vs the CUDA arithmetic |
| `add_inplace` | PASS 1000/1000 | bit-exact |
| `f32_to_bf16_bulk` | PASS 1024/1024 | **bit-exact** vs `bf16_bits.hpp` (round-to-nearest-even, NaN quieted) |
| `f32_to_f16_bulk` | PASS 1024/1024 | **bit-exact** vs `f16_bits.hpp` (RNE, subnormals, overflow→inf) |
| negative control (truncating f16) | PASS (484/1024 differ) | proves the bit-exact gate can FAIL |
| `gdn_gate` (1 and 3 tokens) | PASS, worst rel **4.25e-07** | vs double-precision softplus; tol 5e-6 |
| `rms_norm_weighted` (4 shapes, incl. rows=2) | PASS, worst rel **1.79e-07** | vs double reference **and** a NaN-padded tail that fails if the row guard is missing |
| `silu_inplace` | PASS, worst rel **7.58e-07** | vs the engine's double-precision reference |
| transcendental probe (`exp`, `log`) | INFO | driver `exp` ≈ 9.1e-07, `log` near 1 ≈ 1.5e-07 abs error |

The bf16/f16 conversion fixtures deliberately include exact rounding ties at both precisions, subnormals,
the fp16 overflow point (65504 → 65536), infinities, a signalling NaN pattern and signed zero. The
`rms_norm` case `rows = 2` is the QSA case in the source's own comment: the launcher rounds the grid up, and
a missing `if (row >= rows) return;` overwrites the buffer that follows — so the case pads the allocation
with NaN and requires it to survive.

## Audit

`ports/vulkan/AUDIT.md` — a full pass against the standing code guideline plus the Arc/Vulkan and performance
rules. Nine code-guideline findings (duplicated reference implementation, dead code, parallel containers, a
hardcoded path, a constant repeated nine times, `-Werror`) and six compatibility findings — two of them real
defects (**`rms_norm` coupled the host's dispatch to the driver's subgroup width**, which would skip tail rows
silently on Intel where the driver picks a SIMD width per kernel; and **an fp16 device feature requested with
no fp16 in any kernel**, which fails `vkCreateDevice` on hardware that lacks it). All fixed and re-verified,
four new automated checks added, and each one proven able to fail.

## Two defects found by the gate (both real, both fixed, both measured)

1. **`gdn_gate` first version: softplus lost 4.3e-05 relative.** The delegated translation wrote
   `log(1.0f + exp(x))`; the source uses `log1pf(expf(x))`. A Kahan-form `log1p` did **not** fix it — the
   failure number was identical to five figures, which said the diagnosis was wrong. The actual cause,
   established with a probe shader: the driver's `log` carries ~2^-22 *absolute* error near `u = 1`, which
   breaks the cancellation a Kahan `log1p` depends on, and for negative `x` softplus **is** `exp(x)`, so the
   whole error lands in the result. Replaced with an 18-term series below `z = 0.5` and the driver's `log`
   above it: **4.26e-05 → 4.25e-07**, and the tolerance is now 5e-6 instead of 1e-4.
2. **fp64 `silu` is not expressible with this host's toolchain.** `silu_inplace` computes in double in CUDA.
   GLSL has `double`, but neither glslc (glslang 14.0) nor `glslangValidator` 15.1 can resolve a double
   overload of `exp` for SPIR-V. The port ships the f32 shader and **measures** its gap against the double
   reference (7.58e-07) instead of asserting it away. See `shaders/blocked/README.md`.

## Not done (and how much of the job each is)

* **Waves 2-6 of the kernels** (KV, rope, the GEMVs, attention, MoE, the prefill GEMM): 37 of the 44 CUDA
  kernel files, plus the 8 prefill files and the 7 `cuBLASLt` call sites (which have no Vulkan equivalent and
  must be written by hand). The method and the gate are proven; this is a grind, not an unknown.
* **The engine integration**: no `STRATA_ENABLE_VULKAN`, no arena, no recorded command buffers, no kernel
  registry. `harness/vk_compute.*` is the seed of the device layer, deliberately host-visible-only memory for
  gate fidelity — a real backend needs device-local memory + staging and `VK_EXT_memory_budget`.
* **Anything on Intel hardware.** Zero lines of this port have run on an Arc GPU. No Arc card is attached to
  this box (the two GPUs here are a 7900 XTX and a Quadro K620), so this could not be changed in this
  session. The Vulkan code is written to be card-agnostic and the shaders avoid vendor assumes, but "runs on
  Arc" is unverified and is stated as unverified.
* **The Battlemage stability question** (§4 of the plan): the xe compute wedge is an open driver bug that
  this port cannot fix or test around.

## Estimated remaining cost

* **Kernel waves 2-6 (37 files):** the first wave's 8 kernels took ~40 minutes wall-clock end to end
  including the two defects above, most of it gating. At a similar rate, and with generation offloaded to the
  local model, expect **~2-3 focused sessions**. The long tail (MoE + the 7 quant formats) is the larger half.
* **The GEMM + prefill path:** the only part that is genuine engineering rather than translation. Multi-day.
* **Engine integration to a served model:** ~1 session for a CPU-verifiable path, then a GPU window on the
  hardware that is actually being targeted.
* Cheaper alternative worth considering first: the port buys *compatibility* (Arc, and any Vulkan GPU). If the
  goal is only "Arc runs Strata at a useful speed", the fastest legitimate route is the one Intel validates —
  their LLM Scaler container. This port is the route where the engine stays ours and the model stays GGUF.
